[![Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/CakeDC/TinyMCE/d/total.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/CakeDC/TinyMCE)
[![Latest Version](https://poser.pugx.org/CakeDC/TinyMCE/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/CakeDC/TinyMCE)

The purpose of placing TinyMCE in a plugin is to keep it separate from a themed view, the regular webroot or the app in general, which makes it easier to update and overall follows the idea of keeping the code clean and modular.
